## ARCHITECTURE DESIGN DECISIONS

### Decision Record 001: Beginner-Friendly Start
**Context**: Target audience includes absolute beginners
**Decision**: Chapter 1 provides historical context and gentle introduction
**Rationale**: Avoids overwhelming readers; builds confidence gradually
**Trade-off**: Experienced readers may skip Chapter 1

### Decision Record 002: Vendor-Neutral Core Content
**Context**: Multiple vendor platforms in the market
**Decision**: Core chapters use generic terminology with Cisco examples
**Rationale**: Broader applicability; knowledge transferable
**Trade-off**: Some vendor-specific nuances require Appendix F

### Decision Record 003: Lab-Heavy Approach
**Context**: Switching requires hands-on experience
**Decision**: 40-45 labs with increasing complexity
**Rationale**: Practical skills development; certification prep
**Trade-off**: Requires lab setup investment

### Decision Record 004: Progressive Difficulty
**Context**: Learners need scaffolded instruction
**Decision**: Each chapter builds on previous knowledge
**Rationale**: Cognitive load management; mastery-based progression
**Trade-off**: Challenging to use as reference guide (mitigated by appendices)

### Decision Record 005: Real-World Integration
**Context**: Theory alone doesn't prepare for production networks
**Decision**: Case studies and practical scenarios throughout
**Rationale**: Bridge academic-to-professional gap
**Trade-off**: Case studies date faster than core concepts
